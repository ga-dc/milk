## Documents

### A record in MongoDB is a document
- a data structure composed of field(key) and value pairs.
  - similar to JSON objects.
- fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

---

## Collections

### MongoDB stores documents in collections.
- Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.
- does **NOT** require its documents to have the same schema.
- documents stored in a collection must have a unique `_id` field that acts as a primary key.
